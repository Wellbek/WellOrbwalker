## How to use? 

Start up WellOrbwalker and keep console open. Pick a champ and go into game. Make sure to have "attack move" bind to the default key 'a'. Have fun.

(To change activation key go into settings folder in installation root directory and edit settings.json with any text editor.)

## Why do I need to disable my windows defender? Is it malware?

No, it won't cause any harm. Windows will tell you its a Trojan. Quote: "Details: This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker." - Windows Virus & threat protection
This will occur because the program is indeed executing commands (installing the application and emulating hardware in order for the orbwalker to work without injecting into the game memory).
If you're too scared but still want to try it just pm me on Discord (Well#7347) and I can show you personally.
